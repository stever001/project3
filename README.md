## Installation
***  F o r  D e v e l o p e r s  ***  

1. Clone the repo from stever001/project3. 
2.  Install Backend Dependencies. Navigate to the root directory of the project and then run ’npm install’. 
3. Install Frontend Dependencies. Navigate to the ‘/client’ directory and then run ’npm install’. 

Start The Servers  
Once you have cloned stever001/project3 and installed both the backend and frontend dependencies, you can start both servers at the same time by running /root> npm run dev.   The servers will listen as follows:  
Backend  PORT:4000. 
Frontend  PORT :3000  
Control + c will shut down both of the servers. 

For security reasons .env is not tracked by GitHub  .  You may need to create an .env file in the root of your project, then add the following content to it so it will run:  

DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase  
JWT_SECRET=mysecretkey

This will allow connection to the servers.
